# Fapbunny
*A userscript for navigating submission files and pools with one-handed keyboard shortcuts. ;D*

## Why does this exist?
Because we all want to fap in peace. We want to follow the stories or binge the porno without having
to stop fapping to use the mouse.

## What does it do?
It adds a set of keyboard shortcuts that let you:
* Move to the next file in a multi-file submission.
* Move to the previous file in a multi-file submission.
* Move to the next submission in a pool.
* Move to the previous submission in a pool.

## Sweet! How do I use it?
Fapbunny supports both WASD and the arrow keys, so whether you're a lefty or a righty, I've got you covered!

Use **A and D** or **Left and Right** to go forwards and backwards in a pool.
Use **W and S** or **Up and Down** to go forwards and backwards in single multi-file submissions.

Oh, and I guess you could fap at the same time if you wanted. I dunno, jesus. Use your imagination.

###Enjoy!
